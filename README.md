2. Publish:

    ```
    dotnet publish -c Release
    ```

    Publish output:

    ```
    bin/Release/net8.0/publish/compose/
        docker-compose.yml
        .env          ← copied automatically
    ```

    Docker Compose loads `.env` by convention, so every container started by
    Aspire receives the same `Parameters__username`, `Parameters__password`, …

3. (Optional) Skip the “enter a value” prompt that appears while the manifest is
    being generated by exporting the variables during the publish:

    *bash*  
    ```bash
    export $(cat .env | xargs)
    dotnet publish -c Release
    ```

    *PowerShell*  
    ```powershell
    Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
        $n,$v = $_ -split '=',2
        Set-Item -Path "env:$n" -Value $v
    }
    dotnet publish -c Release
    ```
That’s all—one `.env` file, zero surprises, same values everywhere.

## Web Application
